# horizontal-scroll-picker

Feel free to download, share, credit. Check it out in action here: http://ronaklaungani.com/horizontal-scroll-number-picker/

My main focus was to make sure the code is simple and yet highly customizable! With this code you can change the following things:

The number to start the scroll with (minimum value)
The number to end with (max value)
The difference between each value (step value)
The width of the scroller
The height of the scroller
The color scheme

I feel you can build any type of numeric picker with this simple set of codes. Let me know if you would like me to add updates or change something. Happy to hear some feedback. Thanks!
